# STM32F103 EXTI Driver

This is an external interrupt (EXTI) driver library for the STM32F103 microcontroller series. The EXTI feature allows you to detect and handle external events, such as button presses or other external signals, in your STM32F103-based embedded applications.



## Introduction

The STM32F103 EXTI Driver is designed to simplify the integration of external interrupt functionality into your STM32F103 microcontroller projects. It provides a straightforward and convenient API to configure and handle external interrupts.

## Features

- Easy configuration of external interrupt lines.
- Supports both rising and falling edge trigger modes.
- Callback functions for custom event handling.
- Comprehensive error handling.
