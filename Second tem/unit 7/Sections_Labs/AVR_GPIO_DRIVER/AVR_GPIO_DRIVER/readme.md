# AVR GPIO Driver

This is a GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output) driver library for the AVR microcontroller series. The GPIO driver allows you to configure and control the digital I/O pins of your AVR-based embedded applications.


## Introduction

The AVR GPIO Driver is designed to simplify the configuration and control of digital I/O pins in your AVR microcontroller projects. It provides a straightforward and convenient API to set pin directions, read and write digital values, and perform other GPIO-related operations.

## Features

- Easy configuration of pin directions (input or output).
- Set and clear individual pins or entire ports.
- Read the state of input pins.
- Comprehensive error handling.
