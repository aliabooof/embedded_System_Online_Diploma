## Introduction

This project showcases how to interface and control an LCD display and keypad using the STM32F103 microcontroller. It provides a basic example of how to set up the hardware connections and write code to display information on the LCD and receive input from the keypad.

## Hardware Requirements

To replicate this project, you will need the following hardware components:

- STM32F103 microcontroller board (e.g., [STM32F103C8T6](https://www.st.com/en/microcontrollers-microprocessors/stm32f103.html))
- 16x2 LCD Display with HD44780 controller or compatible
- 4x4 Matrix Keypad
- Breadboard and jumper wires
- Power supply for the STM32F103 board

## Software Requirements

- [STM32CubeIDE](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html) (or your preferred STM32 development environment)
- STM32 HAL library
- Keil, IAR, or other IDE if you prefer a different development environment
- Git (optional, for cloning the repository)

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with the project:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine (if you haven't already):

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stm32f103-lcd-keypad.git
Open the project in your preferred development environment (e.g., STM32CubeIDE).

Connect the LCD and keypad to your STM32F103 board according to the provided schematic or pinout information.

Build and flash the project to your STM32F103 board.

Power up the board and observe the LCD display. You should be able to interact with the keypad and see the results on the LCD.
