## Introduction

Interfacing an LCD and a keypad with an AVR microcontroller is a common requirement in many embedded systems. The LCD provides visual feedback, while the keypad allows user interaction. This project demonstrates how to connect, configure, and use both components together.

## Components Used

- AVR microcontroller (e.g., ATmega16, ATmega328P)
- 16x2 LCD display
- Matrix keypad
- Breadboard and jumper wires
- Power supply (e.g., batteries or external power source)

## Circuit Diagram

![Circuit Diagram](circuit_diagram.png)

Include a circuit diagram here that shows the connections between the AVR microcontroller, LCD, and keypad. You can create one using software like Fritzing or draw it manually.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before starting this project, ensure you have the following:

- An AVR microcontroller development environment set up (e.g., Atmel Studio, avr-gcc).
- Basic knowledge of AVR programming.
- The necessary hardware components listed in the [Components Used](#components-used) section.

### Setup

1. **Hardware Setup**: Connect the LCD and keypad to the AVR microcontroller according to the circuit diagram provided above.

2. **Software Setup**: Set up your AVR development environment and create a new project for this interfacing project.

## Usage

1. **Initialization**: Initialize the LCD and keypad libraries in your AVR code. Configure the necessary ports and pins for communication.

2. **Display**: Use the LCD library to display information on the LCD screen. You can display text messages, numbers, or any relevant data.

3. **Keypad Input**: Use the keypad library to read input from the keypad. Detect key presses and respond accordingly in your code.

4. **Application Logic**: Implement your application logic. For example, you can create a simple calculator, a text editor, or a menu-based interface using the LCD and keypad.

## Sample Code

Include a code snippet or a link to your AVR C code that demonstrates the interfacing of the LCD and keypad. Explain how the code works and how to modify it for your specific application.

```c
// Sample code snippet
#include <avr/io.h>
#include <avr/interrupt.h>
#include "lcd.h"
#include "keypad.h"

int main(void) {
    // Initialize LCD and keypad libraries
    
    while (1) {
        // Read keypad input
        
        // Display data on the LCD
        
        // Implement your application logic here
    }
}
